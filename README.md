## Project Assignment
Cosmo is one hungry kitten, but he hasn't been able to find any BYU creamery chocolate milk for days!
Unfortunately, he is sitting at the end of a hallway, unable to move.

Luckily, you have a quadrotor that happens to have a case of BYU Creamery chocolate milk already loaded up!
Your assignment is to deliver the choco to Cosmo as quick as you can.
But watch out!
Hit any walls and your quadrotor will crash!
